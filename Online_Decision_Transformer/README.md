This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of [Online Deicsion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05607) by [Qinqing Zheng](https://enosair.github.io/), [Amy Zhang](https://amyzhang.github.io/), and [Aditya Grover](https://aditya-grover.github.io/).

  title={Online decision transformer},
  author={Zheng, Qinqing and Zhang, Amy and Grover, Aditya},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.05607},
  year={2022}
}
```

## Requirements
```console
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
source activate odt
```

### Tips
If you encounter the `libstdc++.so.6: version 'GLIBCXX_3.4.xx' not found` error, the following command might help:
```console
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path-to-your-conda-env>/lib
```
I have also found that `tensorboard` wants `protobuf` version to be `3.20.x`, and this helped
```console
# you might need to uninstall dm-control
pip3 install --upgrade protobuf==3.20.0 
```


## Example
To train an ODT agent for `hopper` with the `medium-v2` dataset:
```console
python main.py
```
This will produce the `exp` folder, where all the outputs are going to be logged including tensorboard blobs. One can attach a tensorboard to monitor training by running:
```console
tensorboard --logdir exp
```
